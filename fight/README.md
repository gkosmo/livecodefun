  Let's create fighters, and how they act against each other

  Could we make methods :
		- that give the status of the fighters in a nice presented way ? 
  
  		- that tells us when a fight is over

		- maybe the strength decreasing as the fight goes along and make the question of kicking and punching more strategic 

		- what about a menu from which we can start a game where we create fighters and then make them fight to hp == 0 
	
		- Any idea is welcome !
